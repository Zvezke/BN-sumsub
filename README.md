This is a Next.js project.

## Overview

This project is a minified application to debug fetching the access token from Sumsub.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies. You can use `npm` or `yarn` but I use `pnpm`.

NPM:
```
bash
npm install
```

PNPM:
```
bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:


NPM:
```
bash
npm run dev
```

PNPM:
```
bash
pnpm run dev
```

You will also be needing variables for `.env.local`. Please contact me for the variables.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
